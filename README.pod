Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Twitter - Twitter when you release with Dist::Zilla

=head1 VERSION

version 0.014

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In your C<<< dist.ini >>>:

   [Twitter]
   hash_tags = #foo
   url_shortener = TinyURL

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin will use L<Net::Twitter> to send a release notice to Twitter.
By default, it will include a link to release on L<http://metacpan.org>.

The default configuration is as follows:

   [Twitter]
   tweet_url = https://metacpan.org/release/{{$AUTHOR_UC}}/{{$DIST}}-{{$VERSION}}/
   tweet = Released {{$DIST}}-{{$VERSION}}{{$TRIAL}} {{$URL}}
   url_shortener = TinyURL

The C<<< tweet_url >>> is shortened with L<WWW::Shorten::TinyURL> or
whichever other service you choose and
appended to the C<<< tweet >>> message.  The following variables are
available for substitution in the URL and message templates:

       DIST        # Foo-Bar
       MODULE      # Foo::Bar
       ABSTRACT    # Foo-Bar is a module that FooBars
       VERSION     # 1.23
       TRIAL       # -TRIAL if is_trial, empty string otherwise.
       TARBALL     # Foo-Bar-1.23.tar.gz
       AUTHOR_UC   # JOHNDOE
       AUTHOR_LC   # johndoe
       AUTHOR_PATH # J/JO/JOHNDOE
       URL         # http://tinyurl.com/...

You must be using the C<<< UploadToCPAN >>> or C<<< FakeRelease >>> plugin for this plugin to
determine your CPAN author ID.

You can use the C<<< hash_tags >>> option to append hash tags (or anything,
really) to the end of the message generated from C<<< tweet >>>.
